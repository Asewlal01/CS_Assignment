Between 2006 and 2012 the consumption seemed to be stable within 100 x 1000 hL beer consumption, but started to increase after 2012. This could imply that the years after 2012 and the beer consumption are **correlated**, but the increasing years does not have to be the **cause** of the increase in consumption.
